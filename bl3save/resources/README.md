`inventoryserialdb.json.xz` is generated by the script `gen_inventory_db.py`
right in this directory.  It needs a vanilla `InventorySerialNumberDatabase.dat`
in the same directory to do its work.  (That can be found by unpacking the
BL3 pak files.  Note that this file practically always gets updated with
new patches.)

`short_name_balance_mapping.json.xz` is generated by the script
`gen_short_balance_name_mapping.py` which is found in my
[bl3hotfixmodding](https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding/blob/master/dataprocessing/gen_short_balance_name_mapping.py)
project, in the `dataprocessing` dir.  It relies on the CSVs used for
my balance/part spreadsheets, so we've got a chain of data generation
going on here.
